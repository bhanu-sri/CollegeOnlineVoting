# Project Context

The College Online Voting System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the voting process for college students. It aims to simplify the process of student elections and empower students to participate actively in the democratic process. This system provides a user-friendly interface that allows students to log in using their college registration number and password.

## Key Features

### User Authentication

- **Student Login**: Registered college students can log in using their unique registration number and password. Authentication ensures that only eligible students can access the system.

### Voting System

- **Nomination**: Students can nominate themselves as candidates for various positions in college elections. This includes providing their name, registration number, skills, and highlighting their abilities.
- **Voting**: Eligible students can cast their votes for their preferred candidates. The system ensures that students can only vote once, maintaining the integrity of the election process.
- **Thank You Page**: After voting or nominating, users are presented with a thank-you page confirming their participation.

### Result Viewing

- **Live Results**: The system provides live updates on the top three candidates who have received the most votes. This information is accessible to all users.
- **Admin Access**: Authorized administrators can log in to view detailed election results, including the number of votes each candidate has received.
